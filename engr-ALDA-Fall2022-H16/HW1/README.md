## Question 2:
### Pre-requisites: Make sure you have the following libraries installed
- numpy

### To run the Python file:
1. Download the python code into your machine.
2. Run the python file: python3 h16_hw1_q2.py
3. After that, output should be displayed.

### Example

> python3 h16_hw1_q2.py

<hr>

## Question 3:
### Pre-requisites: Make sure you have the following libraries installed
- pandas
- numpy
- pylab
- matplotlib
- statsmodels

### To run the Python file:
1. Download the [seeds dataset](https://github.ncsu.edu/asfirodi/engr-ALDA-Fall2022-H16/blob/CSC522/HW1/seeds_dataset.csv) from our github repository or from "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds"
2. Download the python code into your machine.
3. Note down the directory path where the seeds_dataset.csv file is located. We need this as an input to the python file.
4. Run the python file: python3 h16_hw1_q3.py
5. Input the filename when prompted. After that, the outputs should be displayed.

### Example

> python h16_hw1_q3.py
  Enter the path to the filename which contains the data: seeds_dataset.csv

## Question 7:

### Pre-requisites: Make sure you have the following libraries installed
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

### To run the Python file:
1. Download the [Algerian Forest Fires dataset]((https://github.ncsu.edu/asfirodi/engr-ALDA-Fall2022-H16/blob/CSC522/HW1/Algerian_forest_fires_dataset_UPDATE.csv)) from our github repository or from "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Algerian+Forest+Fires+Dataset++"
2. Download the python code into your machine.
3. Note down the directory path where the "Algerian_forest_fires_dataset_UPDATE.csv" file is located. Update the filename in the python code for "filename".
4. Run the python file: python3 h16_hw1_q7.py
5. After that, the outputs should be displayed.

### Example

> python h16_hw1_q7.py
